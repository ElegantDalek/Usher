    <string name="kings_summary">The King’s Singers were established in May 1968—one year before the doors of Krannert Center opened—by six recently graduated choral scholars from King’s College, Cambridge, England. The world may have changed a lot in the 50 years since the original King’s Singers came together, but today’s group is still charged by the same driving force—to radiate every day the joy singing brings and to share that excitement with audiences through virtuosity and vision. The King’s Singers’ musical craft, combined with their unique charm and their celebration of great music in all its diversity, has captured hearts worldwide—two Grammy Awards, an Emmy Award, and a place in Gramophone’s Hall of Fame testify to that accomplishment. The ensemble’s Krannert Center program, Finding Harmony, expresses the idea that singing is a language that can be spoken by anyone, and that uniting voices in harmony creates something greater and more beautiful than the sum of its parts. The a cappella performance will contain a delightful range of music, from medieval chant to pop hits, from newly commissioned works to jazz standards.</string>
